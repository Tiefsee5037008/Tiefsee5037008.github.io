# Brief Intro
- Capturing flag since 2022.09
- Mainly interested in Cryptography and Reverse Engineering, also exploring other fields.

# Blog
I write blogs about ctf writeups and *maybe something else* using [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/Tiefsee5037008/Tiefsee5037008.github.io).

# Team
I mainly play on CTFTime using my solo team account [`T5F3C7`](https://ctftime.org/team/207326).

I sometimes also play under the name `TsFeCt` when joining other teams, like [`Ph0t1n1a`](https://ctftime.org/team/55197), [`0ops`](https://ctftime.org/team/4419) and [`*0xA`](https://ctftime.org/team/268941).
